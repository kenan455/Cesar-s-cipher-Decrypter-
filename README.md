# Cesar's cipher Decrypter
This code is a solution for the challenge from codenation.dev/aceleradev/react-online-1.
  The algorithm decrypts a text that i had taken at codenation's API. This text was encrypted with Cesar's cipher, more specifically with the shift 1. After this i encrypt it again using the sha1 algorithm!
